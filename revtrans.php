Usage:

Options:
  --input-format=<plain,encrypted>  Input format to read (Default: encrypted)
  --password=<password>             Password to use for decryption. It is 
                                    discouraged to supply a password on the 
                                    commandline. You will be asked for one if
                                    necessary.
  --output=<file>                   Write output to a file instead of stdout.
